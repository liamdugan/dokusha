## Dokusha - CIS 197 Final Project

Welcome to Dokusha!

Dokusha is an online web app intended to allow users to easily
find reading material at their level when studying foreign languages!

## How does it work?

That's easy, just sign up for an account, choose one of the recommended books, and start reading!

If you finish a book and feel like you understood it, you can add all words in the book to your vocabulary. The more you read, the more your vocabulary bank will grow!

As your vocabulary gets bigger, Dokusha will adjust  the estimated % comprehension of each book accordingly so you can know how you're progressing!

Try to get 100% comprehension in every book!

## What's with the name?

Dokusha (読者) is the Japanese word for reader! Hopefully through this app, you
too will become a better 読者.

## Why was this made?

This was made in late April of 2017 for the UPenn CIS197 (Javascript) final project.
